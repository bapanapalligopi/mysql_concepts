Certainly! Below is a detailed explanation of the loop constructs in MySQL along with the **syntax** for each.

### 1. **`WHILE` Loop**

#### Syntax:

```sql
WHILE <condition> DO
    -- Statements to be executed while the condition is true
END WHILE;
```

- The **`WHILE`** loop evaluates the condition **before** executing the loop body. If the condition is `TRUE`, the loop body is executed. If it's `FALSE`, the loop is skipped, and control passes to the next statement after the loop.

#### Example: Fibonacci using `WHILE` Loop

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE fib(n INT, OUT answer INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 2;
    DECLARE p, q INT DEFAULT 1;
    SET answer = 1;

    -- WHILE loop checks condition before each iteration
    WHILE i < n DO
        SET answer = p + q;
        SET p = q;
        SET q = answer;
        SET i = i + 1;
    END WHILE;
END;
```

- **Initialization**: The variables `p`, `q`, and `i` are initialized. `p` and `q` are the first two Fibonacci numbers, and `i` is the iteration counter.
- **Condition**: The loop runs while `i < n`.
- **Exit Condition**: When `i >= n`, the loop ends.

### 2. **`REPEAT` Loop**

#### Syntax:

```sql
REPEAT
    -- Statements to be executed
UNTIL <condition> END REPEAT;
```

- The **`REPEAT`** loop executes the body of the loop **at least once**. It checks the condition **after** the loop body has executed. If the condition is `TRUE`, the loop exits; if it's `FALSE`, the loop continues.

#### Example: Fibonacci using `REPEAT` Loop

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE fib(n INT, OUT answer INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 1;
    DECLARE p INT DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE q INT DEFAULT 1;
    SET answer = 1;

    -- REPEAT loop checks the condition after each iteration
    REPEAT
        SET answer = p + q;
        SET p = q;
        SET q = answer;
        SET i = i + 1;
    UNTIL i >= n END REPEAT;
END;
```

- **Initialization**: The variables `p`, `q`, and `i` are initialized. Here, `p` starts at `0` because of the way `REPEAT` works (it will run at least once).
- **Condition**: The `UNTIL` condition is checked after each iteration. If `i >= n`, the loop ends.

### 3. **`LOOP` with `ITERATE` and `LEAVE`**

#### Syntax:

```sql
LOOP
    -- Statements to be executed in the loop
    IF <exit_condition> THEN
        LEAVE <loop_label>;  -- Exit the loop
    END IF;
    ITERATE <loop_label>;  -- Optionally skip the remaining part of the loop and continue to the next iteration
END LOOP <loop_label>;
```

- The **`LOOP`** construct is an **infinite loop** unless explicitly exited. It doesn't evaluate a condition at the start. You must use the **`LEAVE`** statement to exit the loop.
- The **`ITERATE`** keyword can be used to skip the remaining loop body and move to the next iteration.

#### Example: Fibonacci using `LOOP` with `LEAVE` and `ITERATE`

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE fib(n INT, OUT answer INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 2;
    DECLARE p, q INT DEFAULT 1;
    SET answer = 1;

    loop1: LOOP
        -- Exit the loop if n-th Fibonacci number is found
        IF i >= n THEN
            LEAVE loop1;  -- Exit loop when the condition is met
        END IF;

        SET answer = p + q;
        SET p = q;
        SET q = answer;
        SET i = i + 1;
    END LOOP loop1;
END;
```

- **Initialization**: Variables `p`, `q`, and `i` are initialized as before.
- **Condition**: The `IF` statement checks if `i >= n`. If so, the **`LEAVE loop1`** command will exit the loop.
- **Exit**: The loop terminates once we reach the Nth Fibonacci number.
- **Iteration**: The loop will keep updating `answer`, `p`, `q`, and `i` in each iteration.

#### Example with `ITERATE`:

If you want to skip certain parts of the loop based on conditions (for example, skipping some steps), you can use the **`ITERATE`** keyword.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE fib(n INT, OUT answer INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 2;
    DECLARE p, q INT DEFAULT 1;
    SET answer = 1;

    loop1: LOOP
        IF i < n THEN
            SET answer = p + q;
            SET p = q;
            SET q = answer;
            SET i = i + 1;
            ITERATE loop1;  -- Skip to next iteration without executing the rest of the loop
        END IF;
        LEAVE loop1;  -- Exit the loop when i >= n
    END LOOP loop1;
END;
```

- The **`ITERATE`** command skips the rest of the loop body if `i < n` and proceeds with the next iteration.
- The loop continues until the exit condition `i >= n` is met, at which point the loop exits with `LEAVE`.

### Summary of Loop Constructs

1. **`WHILE` Loop**: 
   - Checks the condition **before** executing the loop body.
   - Syntax: `WHILE <condition> DO ... END WHILE;`
   - Example: The loop runs as long as `i < n`.

2. **`REPEAT` Loop**:
   - Checks the condition **after** executing the loop body. This means the loop body will run at least once.
   - Syntax: `REPEAT ... UNTIL <condition> END REPEAT;`
   - Example: The loop runs at least once and exits only after checking the condition.

3. **`LOOP` with `ITERATE` and `LEAVE`**:
   - This is an infinite loop unless you use the `LEAVE` statement to exit.
   - You can use `ITERATE` to skip part of the loop and continue to the next iteration.
   - Syntax: `LOOP ... END LOOP <label>;`
   - Example: The `LEAVE` statement is used to exit, and `ITERATE` skips the rest of the loop body for certain conditions.

Each of these loop types can be used based on the specific need of your algorithm. The **`WHILE`** and **`REPEAT`** loops are generally simpler to use and understand, while the **`LOOP`** with `LEAVE` and `ITERATE` provides more flexibility but requires more careful handling to avoid infinite loops.
