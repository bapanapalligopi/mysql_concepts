The **`CASE`** statement in MySQL provides a more compact and readable way to implement conditional logic when you have multiple possible conditions based on the same expression. It's similar to the **`switch`** statement in many programming languages like C, Java, and JavaScript.

In your example, we are implementing the same logic from the previous **`IF`** example using a **`CASE`** statement. The `CASE` statement works by evaluating a single expression (in this case, the `count` variable) and performing different actions depending on its value.

### How `CASE` Works in MySQL:

A **`CASE`** statement evaluates a given expression (like `count`), and for each `WHEN`, it compares the expression to a value. If there's a match, the corresponding `THEN` block of code is executed. The `ELSE` block is optional and runs if none of the `WHEN` conditions match. Finally, the `END CASE` marks the end of the `CASE` block.

### Breakdown of the **`birthday_message`** Procedure Using `CASE`:

Here’s the procedure using the `CASE` statement:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE birthday_message(
    bday DATE,
    OUT message VARCHAR(100))
BEGIN
    DECLARE count INT;
    DECLARE name VARCHAR(100);

    -- Set count to the number of employees with the given birthday
    SET count = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM birthdays WHERE birthday = bday);

    -- CASE statement to decide the message based on the count
    CASE count
        WHEN 0 THEN
            SET message = "Nobody has this birthday";
        WHEN 1 THEN
            -- Get the name of the employee whose birthday matches
            SET name = (SELECT CONCAT(first_name, " ", last_name)
                        FROM employees
                        JOIN birthdays ON emp_id = id
                        WHERE birthday = bday);
            SET message = CONCAT("It's ", name, "'s birthday");
        ELSE
            SET message = "More than one employee has this birthday";
    END CASE;
END
```

### Explanation of the `CASE` Statement:

1. **Evaluate the `count` Expression**:
   - The expression we are evaluating is the variable `count`. The value of `count` is determined earlier by querying the `birthdays` table to see how many employees share the given birthday.

2. **WHEN Clauses**:
   - **`WHEN 0 THEN`**: If `count` is 0 (i.e., no employees share this birthday), then the message is set to "Nobody has this birthday".
   - **`WHEN 1 THEN`**: If `count` is 1 (i.e., exactly one employee has this birthday), the employee’s name is retrieved from the `employees` table, and the message is set to say "It's [name]'s birthday".
   - **`ELSE`**: If the value of `count` is anything other than 0 or 1 (i.e., more than one employee shares the birthday), the message is set to "More than one employee has this birthday".

3. **END CASE**:
   - This marks the end of the `CASE` block.

### Comparing `CASE` to `IF-ELSEIF`:

Let’s compare the logic of using `CASE` with the logic in the earlier **`IF-ELSEIF`** version of the procedure.

#### Using `IF-ELSEIF`:
```sql
IF count = 0 THEN
    SET message = "Nobody has this birthday";
ELSEIF count = 1 THEN
    SET name = (SELECT CONCAT(first_name, " ", last_name)
                FROM employees
                JOIN birthdays ON emp_id = id
                WHERE birthday = bday);
    SET message = CONCAT("It's ", name, "'s birthday");
ELSE
    SET message = "More than one employee has this birthday";
END IF;
```

#### Using `CASE`:
```sql
CASE count
    WHEN 0 THEN
        SET message = "Nobody has this birthday";
    WHEN 1 THEN
        SET name = (SELECT CONCAT(first_name, " ", last_name)
                    FROM employees
                    JOIN birthdays ON emp_id = id
                    WHERE birthday = bday);
        SET message = CONCAT("It's ", name, "'s birthday");
    ELSE
        SET message = "More than one employee has this birthday";
END CASE;
```

### Key Differences:

1. **Readability**:
   - The `CASE` statement is often more **readable** when you're working with multiple possible values of the same expression (like `count`). It's immediately clear that all the logic is branching based on the value of `count`.
   - The `IF-ELSEIF` structure, while still readable, requires more mental effort to track the conditions being tested. It has more keywords (`IF`, `ELSEIF`, `ELSE`, and `END IF`), making the code longer and potentially harder to follow.

2. **Compactness**:
   - The `CASE` block condenses the logic into fewer lines, making it look cleaner, especially when you are checking the same variable (`count` in this case) against multiple values.
   - The `IF-ELSEIF` structure can get more verbose when you're adding additional conditions or tests.

3. **Use Case**:
   - Use **`CASE`** when you have a single expression (`count` in this case) that is being compared against multiple possible values. It’s very useful when you have many conditions that evaluate the same expression.
   - Use **`IF-ELSEIF`** when you need more complex logic or when your conditions involve more than simple equality checks (like range checks or more complex expressions).

### Example Outputs:

- **Case 1: No employees with the birthday**:
    ```sql
    CALL birthday_message(NOW(), @message);
    -- Result: "Nobody has this birthday"
    ```

- **Case 2: One employee has the birthday**:
    ```sql
    CALL birthday_message('1980-02-03', @message);
    -- Result: "It's tim sehn's birthday"
    ```

- **Case 3: Multiple employees have the birthday**:
    ```sql
    CALL birthday_message('1985-01-10', @message);
    -- Result: "More than one employee has this birthday"
    ```

### Summary:

- The **`CASE`** statement is a concise, clear way of handling multiple conditions based on a single expression, making it ideal for situations where you're comparing the same variable against several possible values.
- It's particularly useful in cases where there are many potential conditions and helps make the code more readable and maintainable.
- While **`IF-ELSEIF`** is still a valid choice, **`CASE`** provides a more streamlined approach when working with a set of conditions based on one variable.
