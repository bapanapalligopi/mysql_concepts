In MySQL, loop constructs provide a way to repeat a set of SQL statements multiple times. There are three primary loop constructs available: **`WHILE`**, **`REPEAT`**, and **`LOOP`**. The choice between them depends on the specific behavior you're aiming for in your logic, such as when you want to evaluate the condition and how many times the loop should run.

Let's go through each loop construct in the context of calculating the Nth Fibonacci number, explaining how each one works and when to use them.

### 1. **WHILE Loop**

The **`WHILE`** loop checks the loop condition **before** entering the loop body. It continues looping as long as the condition is `TRUE`.

#### Example - Fibonacci using WHILE Loop:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE fib(n INT, OUT answer INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 2;
    DECLARE p, q INT DEFAULT 1;
    SET answer = 1;
    
    -- WHILE loop checks the condition before each iteration
    WHILE i < n DO
        SET answer = p + q;
        SET p = q;
        SET q = answer;
        SET i = i + 1;
    END WHILE;
END;
```

#### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: We initialize `p` and `q` to `1` and `i` to `2`. These variables represent the two previous Fibonacci numbers (starting with 1, 1).
- **Looping**: The `WHILE` loop runs as long as `i < n`. During each iteration:
  - We calculate the next Fibonacci number (`answer = p + q`).
  - Update `p` and `q` to move to the next pair of Fibonacci numbers.
  - Increment `i` to keep track of how many iterations have been done.
- **Exit Condition**: The loop exits when `i >= n`, meaning we've calculated the `n`th Fibonacci number.

#### Testing:

```sql
SET @answer = 1;
CALL fib(6, @answer);
SELECT @answer;  -- Output: 8

SET @answer = 1;
CALL fib(7, @answer);
SELECT @answer;  -- Output: 13
```

### 2. **REPEAT Loop**

The **`REPEAT`** loop checks the condition **after** the loop body has been executed. This means that the body of the loop will always execute at least once, even if the condition is initially `FALSE`.

#### Example - Fibonacci using REPEAT Loop:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE fib(n INT, OUT answer INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 1;
    DECLARE p INT DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE q INT DEFAULT 1;
    SET answer = 1;
    
    -- REPEAT loop checks condition after the loop body
    REPEAT
        SET answer = p + q;
        SET p = q;
        SET q = answer;
        SET i = i + 1;
    UNTIL i >= n END REPEAT;
END;
```

#### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: We initialize `p` to `0`, `q` to `1`, and `i` to `1`.
- **Looping**: The `REPEAT` loop executes the body at least once, and then checks the condition `UNTIL i >= n`. Each iteration updates the Fibonacci numbers just like the **`WHILE`** loop.
- **Exit Condition**: The loop exits once `i` reaches or exceeds `n`.

#### Key Difference from WHILE:
- The **`REPEAT`** loop always executes at least once, which means we start the Fibonacci calculation even if `n` is very small.
- This loop is useful when you need to ensure that the loop executes at least once, which is why the starting value of `i` is initialized to `1` (not `2` as in the `WHILE` loop).

### 3. **LOOP with `ITERATE` and `LEAVE`**

The **`LOOP`** construct is an infinite loop unless you specify an explicit exit condition. You must use a **`LEAVE`** statement to exit the loop. If you want to skip certain parts of the loop but continue, you can use **`ITERATE`**.

#### Example - Fibonacci using LOOP with `LEAVE` and `ITERATE`:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE fib(n INT, OUT answer INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 2;
    DECLARE p, q INT DEFAULT 1;
    SET answer = 1;
    
    -- LABEL for the loop
    loop1: LOOP
        -- Exit the loop if we have reached or passed the desired Fibonacci number
        IF i >= n THEN
            LEAVE loop1;
        END IF;
        
        SET answer = p + q;
        SET p = q;
        SET q = answer;
        SET i = i + 1;
    END LOOP loop1;
END;
```

#### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: `p` and `q` start at `1`, and `i` starts at `2`. This is similar to the `WHILE` and `REPEAT` examples.
- **Looping**: The `LOOP` keeps running until an explicit condition (`IF i >= n THEN LEAVE loop1;`) tells it to exit.
- **LEAVE Statement**: The **`LEAVE`** statement breaks out of the loop once we've calculated the `n`th Fibonacci number.
- **Labeling**: The loop is labeled as `loop1`, and the `LEAVE loop1` tells MySQL which loop to exit.

#### Using `ITERATE` (optional):

If you want to skip the rest of the loop and continue with the next iteration, you can use **`ITERATE`**. Here's an example:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE fib(n INT, OUT answer INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 2;
    DECLARE p, q INT DEFAULT 1;
    SET answer = 1;

    loop1: LOOP
        IF i < n THEN
            SET answer = p + q;
            SET p = q;
            SET q = answer;
            SET i = i + 1;
            ITERATE loop1;  -- Skip to the next iteration
        END IF;
        
        LEAVE loop1;  -- Exit when the loop condition is met
    END LOOP loop1;
END;
```

#### Explanation of `ITERATE`:
- **`ITERATE loop1;`** is used to skip the remaining part of the loop and continue with the next iteration, which can be useful if you want to avoid certain actions under specific conditions without leaving the loop entirely.

### Summary of Loop Constructs:

- **`WHILE` Loop**: Checks the condition at the **beginning** of each iteration. Use this when you want to run the loop only if the condition is true at the start.
  
- **`REPEAT` Loop**: Checks the condition **after** the loop body. This means the body of the loop always runs at least once. Use this when you need to ensure the loop executes at least once regardless of the condition.

- **`LOOP` with `LEAVE` and `ITERATE`**: The `LOOP` does not check a condition at the start. It is controlled entirely by **`LEAVE`** (to exit the loop) and **`ITERATE`** (to skip to the next iteration). Use this when you need full control over the flow of execution within the loop.

Each of these loops has its use cases depending on the condition-checking strategy, and choosing the right one can make your code clearer and more efficient.
