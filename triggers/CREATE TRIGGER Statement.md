Here’s the **complete syntax** for the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement in MySQL:

```sql
CREATE [DEFINER = user]
    TRIGGER [IF NOT EXISTS] trigger_name
    trigger_time trigger_event
    ON tbl_name FOR EACH ROW
    [trigger_order]
    trigger_body;
```

### Explanation of the syntax components:

1. **CREATE TRIGGER**:  
   This is the keyword used to create a new trigger in MySQL.

2. **DEFINER = user** (Optional):
   - Specifies the account that defines the trigger (i.e., the user whose privileges the trigger will execute under).
   - **Syntax**: `DEFINER = 'user'@'host'`
   - If omitted, the current user will be used.

3. **IF NOT EXISTS** (Optional, MySQL 8.0.29+):
   - Prevents the creation of a trigger if one with the same name already exists for the same table in the same schema.

4. **trigger_name**:
   - The name of the trigger. It must be unique within the schema.
   
5. **trigger_time**:
   - The time when the trigger should fire.
   - It can be either:
     - `BEFORE` — The trigger will fire **before** the specified event.
     - `AFTER` — The trigger will fire **after** the specified event.
   
6. **trigger_event**:
   - The type of event that will activate the trigger. It can be one of the following:
     - `INSERT` — Trigger is activated when a new row is inserted.
     - `UPDATE` — Trigger is activated when a row is updated.
     - `DELETE` — Trigger is activated when a row is deleted.
   
7. **ON tbl_name**:
   - The name of the table on which the trigger is created. The trigger will activate when the specified event occurs on this table.

8. **FOR EACH ROW**:
   - This keyword indicates that the trigger will fire for each row affected by the event.

9. **trigger_order** (Optional):
   - This option specifies the order in which the trigger should fire relative to other triggers on the same event.
   - It can be either:
     - `PRECEDES other_trigger_name` — The trigger will fire before the specified trigger.
     - `FOLLOWS other_trigger_name` — The trigger will fire after the specified trigger.
   
10. **trigger_body**:
    - This is the block of code (usually in the form of SQL statements) that defines the trigger’s action. It can include multiple SQL statements that execute when the trigger is fired. The body is enclosed in a `BEGIN ... END` block if it contains multiple statements.

### Full Example:

```sql
CREATE DEFINER = 'admin'@'localhost'
    TRIGGER check_salary_before_insert
    BEFORE INSERT ON employees
    FOR EACH ROW
    BEGIN
        -- Trigger action: Ensure salary is above 3000 before inserting a new employee
        IF NEW.salary < 3000 THEN
            SET NEW.salary = 3000;
        END IF;
    END;
```

### Full Syntax Breakdown:

- **CREATE DEFINER = 'admin'@'localhost'**: The trigger is created by the `admin` user from `localhost`.
- **TRIGGER check_salary_before_insert**: The trigger is named `check_salary_before_insert`.
- **BEFORE INSERT ON employees**: The trigger will activate before an insert operation on the `employees` table.
- **FOR EACH ROW**: The trigger will be applied to each row being inserted.
- **BEGIN ... END**: The trigger body contains an `IF` condition to check if the salary is less than 3000, and if so, it will set the salary to 3000 before the insert operation proceeds.

This is the complete structure for creating triggers in MySQL.
