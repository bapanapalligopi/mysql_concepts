You've outlined the steps for building the persistent layer in MySQL very clearly! Here's a bit more elaboration and useful tips that might come in handy:

---

### 📚 **Creating the Database**

✅ **Syntax:**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE [IF NOT EXISTS] database_name;
```
- `IF NOT EXISTS` prevents errors if the database already exists.
- Database names are **case-sensitive** in UNIX-based systems but **case-insensitive** in Windows.

✅ **Example:**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS casperstay_db;
```
👉 **Tip:** It's always a good practice to use `IF NOT EXISTS` to avoid unintended errors.

---

### 🎯 **Selecting the Database**

✅ **Syntax:**
```sql
USE database_name;
```
- This command switches the active database so that subsequent queries are executed in that database.

✅ **To check the currently selected database:**
```sql
SELECT DATABASE();
```
- This returns the name of the database currently in use.

---

### 🗑️ **Dropping the Database**

✅ **Syntax:**
```sql
DROP DATABASE [IF EXISTS] database_name;
```
- `IF EXISTS` prevents errors if the specified database does not exist.

✅ **Example:**
```sql
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS casperstay_db;
```
⚠️ **Warning:** Dropping a database will remove all tables, views, stored procedures, and associated objects. Use this command carefully!

### 🚀 **Next Steps: Designing the Database for CasperStay**

When designing the database for the **CasperStay** application, you’ll want to:

1. **Identify Entities and Relationships:**
   - Example entities: `Users`, `Properties`, `Bookings`, `Payments`, etc.
   - Define relationships like one-to-many (1:M) or many-to-many (M:M).

2. **Define Tables and Columns:**
   - Define appropriate data types and constraints such as `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, and `NOT NULL`.

3. **Normalize the Database:**
   - Normalize to at least **3NF (Third Normal Form)** to eliminate redundancy and ensure data integrity.

4. **Indexing for Performance:**
   - Create indexes on frequently searched columns to improve query performance.

💡 **Pro Tip:** You can visualize your database design using tools like **MySQL Workbench** before starting with the DDL scripts.
