### ðŸ“š **Brief Overview of `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` in MySQL**

`INFORMATION_SCHEMA` is a system database in MySQL that provides **metadata** about databases, tables, columns, and other objects. It acts as a **data dictionary** that helps retrieve information about the database structure.

### ðŸ”Ž **Key Points:**
1. **Purpose:**
   - Provides information about databases, tables, columns, indexes, and privileges.
   - Acts as an alternative to `SHOW` statements.

2. **Read-Only Nature:**
   - Tables in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` are actually **views**, not physical tables.
   - You can only perform `SELECT` queries â€” no `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` allowed.

3. **Common Tables:**
   - `TABLES` â€“ Contains information about all tables.
   - `COLUMNS` â€“ Details about each column in a table.
   - `VIEWS` â€“ Metadata about views.
   - `STATISTICS` â€“ Index information.
   - `ROUTINES` â€“ Information about stored procedures and functions.

4. **Privileges:**
   - Users can see only information they have privileges for.
   - For some columns (like `ROUTINE_DEFINITION`), insufficient privileges return `NULL`.

5. **Performance Considerations:**
   - Queries that access multiple databases can be slow.
   - Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze query performance.

6. **Standards Compliance:**
   - Follows ANSI/ISO SQL:2003 standards, but includes MySQL-specific extensions (e.g., `ENGINE` column in `TABLES`).

### ðŸ“Œ **Example Query:**
```sql
SELECT TABLE_NAME, TABLE_TYPE, ENGINE
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'my_database';
```
âœ… Retrieves table names, types, and storage engines for `my_database`.
