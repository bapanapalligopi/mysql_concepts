### 13.1.4 **Floating-Point Types (Approximate Value) - FLOAT, DOUBLE**

In MySQL, the **FLOAT** and **DOUBLE** types are used to store approximate numeric data values. These types are essential when you need to store values with large ranges, but the precision is not the primary concern. Unlike **DECIMAL** or **NUMERIC** types, which store exact values, **FLOAT** and **DOUBLE** store values with a level of approximation.

### Key Concepts:
- **FLOAT**: A single-precision floating-point number.
- **DOUBLE**: A double-precision floating-point number.
  
### Storage Requirements:
- **FLOAT** uses **4 bytes** (single precision).
- **DOUBLE** uses **8 bytes** (double precision).
  
This is essential when you're working with very large or very small numbers that cannot be represented accurately by integer types or when the exact precision is not critical.

### **FLOAT(p)** and **DOUBLE(p)** Syntax:
- **FLOAT** and **DOUBLE** can be optionally specified with precision `(p)` in parentheses, where `p` indicates the total number of bits of precision (for storage).
- For **FLOAT**:
  - A precision `p` of **0 to 23** results in a **single-precision** value (4 bytes).
  - A precision `p` of **24 to 53** results in a **double-precision** value (8 bytes).
  
- For **DOUBLE**:
  - It represents **double-precision** floating-point numbers, which use **8 bytes** for storage.

### Nonstandard Syntax (Deprecated):
- **FLOAT(M,D)** or **DOUBLE(M,D)** syntax is used for **display length** and **decimal precision**, where `M` is the total number of digits (precision) and `D` is the number of digits after the decimal point (scale).
  
  Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE measurements (
      weight FLOAT(7,4)  -- Stores up to 7 digits, with 4 digits after the decimal point.
  );
  ```

  In this case, values in the **weight** column will be displayed up to 7 digits, with 4 digits after the decimal point, such as `-999.9999`.

  **NOTE**: As of MySQL 8.0.17, the `FLOAT(M,D)` and `DOUBLE(M,D)` syntax is deprecated, and it will be removed in future MySQL versions. So, it's recommended to avoid using these and to rely on the standard `FLOAT` or `DOUBLE` types.

### **Behavior of Floating-Point Types**:
- **Approximation**: Since `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE` are approximate, they are **not ideal** for exact comparisons. Their value might not match exactly due to rounding or slight precision errors. This is particularly noticeable when performing equality checks.
  
  Example of approximation:
  ```sql
  SELECT 0.1 + 0.2;  -- Might not return exactly 0.3 due to precision issues.
  ```

- **Rounding**: When inserting values into a **FLOAT(M,D)** or **DOUBLE(M,D)** column, MySQL performs rounding to fit the defined precision and scale.

  Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE scores (
      score FLOAT(6,2)
  );

  INSERT INTO scores (score) VALUES (123.456);
  -- The value stored will be rounded to 123.46
  ```

---

### **Examples of Creating Tables with FLOAT and DOUBLE**:

1. **Creating a Table with FLOAT**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE weather_data (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       temperature FLOAT(5,2)  -- 5 digits in total, 2 digits after the decimal point
   );
   ```

   In this case, the **temperature** column can store values like **999.99**, **-50.50**, and so on, with **2 decimal places**.

2. **Inserting Values**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO weather_data (id, temperature)
   VALUES (1, 32.75), (2, -5.23), (3, 15.50);
   ```

   This will insert data into the **weather_data** table. The temperatures will be rounded if needed, according to the specified precision and scale.

3. **Creating a Table with DOUBLE**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE financial_data (
       id INT PRIMARY KEY,
       interest_rate DOUBLE  -- Stores floating-point values with double precision
   );
   ```

   The **interest_rate** column can store values like **0.04567** with more precision due to **double-precision** storage.

4. **Inserting Values into a DOUBLE Column**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO financial_data (id, interest_rate)
   VALUES (1, 0.0425), (2, 0.0509);
   ```

### **Challenges with Floating-Point Types**:
1. **Imprecision**: Operations on floating-point numbers can introduce minor errors due to the approximate nature of the data type. For example:
   ```sql
   SELECT 0.1 + 0.2;  -- Might return 0.30000000000000004 instead of 0.3
   ```

2. **Use for Large Data Ranges**: Floating-point types are useful when you need to handle very large numbers or very small numbers but are okay with a little approximation.

3. **Comparison Issues**: Avoid comparing floating-point values using `=` or `<>` (equality checks). Use a **tolerance range** for comparisons:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM weather_data WHERE ABS(temperature - 32.75) < 0.01;
   ```

---

### **Best Practices**:
- Use **FLOAT** or **DOUBLE** when you need a large range of values but do not require exact precision (e.g., for scientific calculations or approximations).
- For **monetary values** or situations where **exact precision** is critical, prefer **DECIMAL** or **NUMERIC** types instead of **FLOAT** or **DOUBLE**.
