### 📅 **What Calendar Does MySQL Use?**

MySQL uses a **proleptic Gregorian calendar**, which means that it applies **Gregorian calendar rules to all dates**, even those that occurred before the actual switch from the **Julian calendar**.

---

### 📖 **Understanding the Proleptic Gregorian Calendar**

- **Julian Calendar:**  
   - Introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BCE.
   - A year was defined as 365.25 days, leading to a slight drift over the centuries.

- **Gregorian Calendar:**
   - Introduced by Pope Gregory XIII in 1582 to correct the drift caused by the Julian calendar.
   - Adjusts leap years to keep the calendar aligned with the solar year.

---

### 🕰️ **The Cutover: Julian to Gregorian Calendar**

The switch from Julian to Gregorian resulted in a **cutover** period, where a number of days were skipped to correct the drift.

#### 🎯 **First Cutover in 1582:**
- Thursday, **October 4, 1582** was followed by **Friday, October 15, 1582**.
- Days between October 5 and 14 were skipped.

#### 📆 **October 1582 Calendar:**
```
Monday   Tuesday   Wednesday   Thursday   Friday    Saturday   Sunday
 1         2         3           4         15         16        17
18        19        20          21         22         23        24
25        26        27          28         29         30        31
```

### 🌍 **Cutover Dates Vary by Country**

- **1582:** Spain, Portugal, Italy, and Poland were the first to adopt the Gregorian calendar.
- **1752:** Great Britain and its colonies adopted the Gregorian calendar.
   - **Wednesday, September 2, 1752,** was followed by **Thursday, September 14, 1752.**
- **1918:** Russia switched after the **October Revolution** (Julian date) which was actually in **November** according to the Gregorian calendar.

### ⚡️ **Proleptic Gregorian Calendar in MySQL**

A **proleptic calendar** applies modern calendar rules to historical dates, even before they were officially used.

- **MySQL's Behavior:**
   - MySQL treats all dates using **Gregorian rules**, regardless of the historical cutover in different countries.
   - This means:
     - Dates before October 15, 1582, are treated using Gregorian rules.
     - No Julian-to-Gregorian transition is considered.
     - This is consistent with **standard SQL requirements**.

---

### ⚠️ **Important Considerations:**

1. **Dates Before 1582:**
   - Since MySQL uses a **proleptic Gregorian calendar**, dates prior to 1582 may not align with historical reality.
   - Example:
   ```sql
   SELECT DATE('1582-10-05');
   -- Treated as a valid date, but it did not exist in the real calendar.
   ```

2. **Cross-country Discrepancies:**
   - Different countries adopted the Gregorian calendar at different times.
   - Events recorded under the Julian calendar may have different dates when converted to the Gregorian system.

---

### 📚 **Examples in MySQL:**

#### ✅ **Valid Date Before 1582:**
```sql
SELECT DATE('1582-10-04');
```
Returns:
```
1582-10-04
```

#### ❗ **Date During Cutover (Nonexistent):**
```sql
SELECT DATE('1582-10-10');
```
- MySQL treats it as a valid date, but historically, this date did **not exist**.

#### 📅 **Date After Cutover:**
```sql
SELECT DATE('1582-10-15');
```
Returns:
```
1582-10-15
```
- Gregorian calendar takes over.

---

### 🕰️ **Impact of Using Proleptic Calendar**

- **Event Dates May Shift:** Historical dates recorded under the Julian calendar might be off by several days.
- **Date Calculations:** Date arithmetic and interval calculations in MySQL always use Gregorian rules.

---

### 🎯 **Summary:**
- MySQL uses a **proleptic Gregorian calendar**, applying modern calendar rules to all dates, including those before the actual Julian-to-Gregorian switch.
- Dates prior to the historical cutover may not align with real-world events.
- Different countries adopted the Gregorian calendar at different times, but MySQL ignores these differences for simplicity and consistency.
