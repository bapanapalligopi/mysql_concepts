### 13.1.5 **BIT-Value Type - BIT**

The **BIT** data type is used in MySQL to store **bit values**. Bit values are binary numbers consisting of 0s and 1s. The **BIT** type can be used to represent boolean values (true/false), or as a way to efficiently store compact data.

### Key Concepts:
- **BIT(M)**: A column definition that uses the **BIT** data type, where `M` specifies the number of bits that can be stored in the column.
  - `M` can range from **1 to 64** in MySQL.
  - The size of the **BIT** column is dependent on `M`, and MySQL stores these bits efficiently in memory.
  
### **Usage of BIT**:
- The **BIT** type is typically used when you need to store a sequence of binary values (like flags, binary options, or boolean values) or when working with very compact data.
  
- You can define a **BIT** column with a specific length `M` to store **M-bit** values, where `M` is between 1 and 64. 

---

### **Syntax**:
- **BIT(M)**: 
  - `M` is the number of bits you want to store, and it can range from 1 to 64.
  - The default value of `M` is 1 if not specified.
  
  Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE example (
      bit_value BIT(5)
  );
  ```

  In this example, **bit_value** can store a binary number that uses **5 bits**.

---

### **Assigning Bit Values**:
- You can insert binary values into a **BIT** column using **binary literals** in the form of `b'value'`, where `value` consists of zeros (`0`) and ones (`1`).
  
  Example:
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO example (bit_value) VALUES (b'10101');
  ```

  Here, the binary value `b'10101'` is inserted into the `bit_value` column.

---

### **Padding of BIT Values**:
- If you insert a **bit value** that is shorter than the specified `M` bits, MySQL **pads** the value with zeros on the left to match the defined length.

  Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE example2 (
      bit_value BIT(8)
  );
  
  INSERT INTO example2 (bit_value) VALUES (b'101');
  ```

  In this case, the binary value `b'101'` is padded to `b'00000101'` (left-padded with zeros) to fill the 8 bits.

---

### **Bit Values and NDB Cluster**:
- In **NDB Cluster**, a limitation applies: the **maximum combined size** of all **BIT** columns in a table cannot exceed **4096 bits**.

---

### **Examples**:

1. **Creating a Table with a BIT Column**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE user_flags (
       user_id INT,
       is_active BIT(1),
       is_verified BIT(1)
   );
   ```

   In this table:
   - `is_active` and `is_verified` are **1-bit** fields, which could represent boolean values (e.g., `0` for `false`, `1` for `true`).
  
2. **Inserting Data**:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO user_flags (user_id, is_active, is_verified)
   VALUES (1, b'1', b'0');
   ```

   In this case:
   - `is_active` is `1` (active).
   - `is_verified` is `0` (not verified).
  
3. **Padding Example**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE flag_example (
       status BIT(8)
   );
   
   INSERT INTO flag_example (status) VALUES (b'101');
   ```

   Here, the value `b'101'` will be padded to `b'00000101'` to match the **8-bit** column size.

---

### **Use Cases for BIT**:
- **Flags**: Useful for representing binary flags, such as `active` or `inactive`, `approved` or `not approved`, or `true` and `false` values.
- **Compact Storage**: When you need to store a large number of binary data (e.g., representing a series of boolean flags in a compact form).
- **Efficient Data Representation**: Using **BIT** columns can be much more efficient in terms of storage and performance when dealing with a large set of binary data compared to using multiple **BOOLEAN** or **TINYINT** columns.

---

### **Limitations**:
1. **Limited Range**: The maximum bit length (`M`) for the **BIT** type is 64, which may not be suitable for extremely large binary data storage.
2. **Not Ideal for Large Data**: For larger data storage, consider using **BLOB** or **TEXT** data types instead.
3. **NDB Cluster Limitation**: As mentioned earlier, NDB Cluster imposes a limit of 4096 bits for the total combined size of **BIT** columns in a table.

---

### **Best Practices**:
- Use **BIT** when you need to store a small, compact binary value, such as a flag, binary decision, or status indicator.
- For storage of large binary data, such as images or files, use other data types like **BLOB** or **TEXT**.
  
By using **BIT**, you can store binary values efficiently, especially in systems that require bit-level data manipulation or compact binary storage.
