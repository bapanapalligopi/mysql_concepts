In MySQL stored programs, **variables** are essential for holding temporary values, managing flow control, and processing data. Variables in stored programs can be **local variables**, **system variables**, or **user-defined variables**.

### 1. **Local Variable DECLARE Statement**
Local variables are used within a stored program (e.g., stored procedures, functions, triggers) to store and manipulate values. These variables are defined within the scope of the stored program using the `DECLARE` statement.

#### Syntax for Declaring Local Variables:
```sql
DECLARE variable_name datatype [DEFAULT value];
```
- `variable_name` is the name of the variable.
- `datatype` is the type of data the variable can hold (e.g., `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DECIMAL`).
- `DEFAULT value` is optional; it assigns an initial value to the variable.

### Example of Declaring a Local Variable:
```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE calculate_discount()
BEGIN
    DECLARE discount DECIMAL(5, 2) DEFAULT 10.00;
    DECLARE total_amount DECIMAL(10, 2);
    
    -- Set total_amount based on query result
    SELECT SUM(price) INTO total_amount FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics';
    
    -- Calculate the discounted amount
    SET total_amount = total_amount - (total_amount * discount / 100);
    
    -- Return the final total after discount
    SELECT total_amount AS FinalPrice;
END $$

DELIMITER ;
```
In this example:
- `discount` is a local variable that holds the discount percentage.
- `total_amount` is another local variable that holds the total sum of prices from a query.

### 2. **Setting Values to Variables**
You can assign values to local variables directly using the `SET` statement or retrieve results from queries using the `SELECT ... INTO` statement.

#### Setting Values with `SET`:
```sql
SET variable_name = value;
```

Example:
```sql
SET discount = 15.00;
```

#### Retrieving Query Results into Variables:
You can retrieve data from a `SELECT` query directly into variables.

```sql
SELECT column_name INTO variable_name FROM table WHERE condition;
```

Example:
```sql
SELECT SUM(price) INTO total_amount FROM products WHERE category = 'Electronics';
```

### 3. **Using Cursors to Fetch Data into Variables**
Cursors allow you to fetch data row by row, which is particularly useful when you need to process a result set one record at a time.

```sql
DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR 
SELECT column_name FROM table WHERE condition;

OPEN cursor_name;
FETCH cursor_name INTO variable_name;
```

### 4. **Local Variable Scope and Resolution**
- **Scope**: Local variables are only accessible within the **stored program** in which they are declared. They cannot be accessed outside of that program.
- **Resolution**: If a variable name conflicts with a column or other variable names, MySQL will resolve this ambiguity based on the context in which the variable is used. For example, if a local variable has the same name as a column in a table, MySQL will prioritize the local variable in the scope of the stored program.

### 5. **Important Points on Variables in Stored Programs**
- Local variables are scoped only within the program or routine in which they are declared.
- **System variables** (such as `@@global.max_connections`) and **user-defined variables** (e.g., `@user_var`) can also be used inside stored programs, but **local variables** take precedence when there's a naming conflict.
- **Cannot assign DEFAULT**: You cannot assign `DEFAULT` to parameters or local variables inside a stored program (e.g., `SET var_name = DEFAULT;` will result in an error).

### Example of Local Variable Scope:
```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE example_scope()
BEGIN
    DECLARE my_var INT DEFAULT 5;
    
    -- Local variable is used within the scope
    SELECT my_var;  -- Returns 5
    
    -- If a column name is the same as a local variable, MySQL prioritizes the local variable
    SELECT my_var FROM employees;  -- It will use the local variable 'my_var', not the column
    
END $$

DELIMITER ;
```
In this case, the local variable `my_var` shadows any column with the same name within the stored procedure. However, outside the procedure, the column value would be used if there is no conflict.

### Summary:
- **Local variables** in stored programs are declared using `DECLARE` and can store temporary data.
- Use `SET` and `SELECT INTO` to assign values to variables.
- **Cursors** can be used for row-by-row processing and fetching results into variables.
- Local variables are **scoped to the stored program** and are not accessible outside of it.
