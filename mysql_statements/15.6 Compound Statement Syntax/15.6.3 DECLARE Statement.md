The `DECLARE` statement in MySQL is used to declare variables, conditions, handlers, and cursors within a stored program such as a stored procedure, function, trigger, or event. The `DECLARE` statement must be used inside a `BEGIN ... END` block and must be declared before any other executable statements in the block.

### Syntax:
```sql
DECLARE variable_name datatype [DEFAULT value];
DECLARE handler_name HANDLER FOR condition_name action;
DECLARE cursor_name CURSOR FOR select_statement;
```

### Explanation of `DECLARE` Components:
1. **Local Variables**: You can declare local variables to store values temporarily within a stored program.
2. **Conditions and Handlers**: You can declare conditions (error conditions) and their corresponding handlers to manage errors or other conditions.
3. **Cursors**: Cursors allow you to process query results row by row in stored programs.

### Rules:
1. **DECLARE** statements must appear at the start of the `BEGIN ... END` block.
2. **Order**: 
   - Cursor declarations should appear before handler declarations.
   - Variable and condition declarations must appear before cursor or handler declarations.

### Examples:

#### 1. Declaring Variables:
Variables are used to store data temporarily. You can use them to store the results of queries or perform operations.

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE example_procedure()
BEGIN
    DECLARE total_sales DECIMAL(10, 2);
    DECLARE employee_count INT;
    
    -- Set variables based on queries
    SELECT SUM(sales_amount) INTO total_sales FROM sales WHERE sale_date = CURDATE();
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO employee_count FROM employees WHERE status = 'active';
    
    -- Use variables
    SELECT total_sales AS 'Total Sales', employee_count AS 'Active Employees';
END $$

DELIMITER ;
```

In the above example:
- `total_sales` and `employee_count` are declared to store the sum of sales for the current day and the number of active employees, respectively.

#### 2. Declaring Handlers:
Handlers are used to deal with exceptions or specific conditions. For example, if a query fails, you might want to perform some action, like rolling back a transaction or logging an error.

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE handle_error_example()
BEGIN
    DECLARE exit handler FOR SQLEXCEPTION
        BEGIN
            -- Rollback in case of an error
            ROLLBACK;
            SELECT 'An error occurred' AS ErrorMessage;
        END;
    
    -- Start the transaction
    START TRANSACTION;
    
    -- Simulate an error (divide by zero)
    DECLARE result INT;
    SET result = 10 / 0;  -- This will generate an error and trigger the handler
    
    COMMIT;  -- This will not be reached if the error occurs
END $$

DELIMITER ;
```

In this example:
- A handler for `SQLEXCEPTION` (SQL errors) is declared.
- If an error occurs (e.g., division by zero), the handler will roll back the transaction and display an error message.

#### 3. Declaring Cursors:
Cursors allow row-by-row processing of query results. They are useful for iterating through results when you need to perform operations on each row.

```sql
DELIMITER $$

CREATE PROCEDURE cursor_example()
BEGIN
    DECLARE done INT DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE emp_id INT;
    DECLARE emp_name VARCHAR(255);
    
    -- Declare cursor to fetch employee information
    DECLARE employee_cursor CURSOR FOR 
        SELECT employee_id, name FROM employees WHERE status = 'active';
    
    -- Declare the handler to end the loop
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = 1;
    
    -- Open the cursor
    OPEN employee_cursor;
    
    -- Loop through all rows
    read_loop: LOOP
        FETCH employee_cursor INTO emp_id, emp_name;
        
        IF done THEN
            LEAVE read_loop;
        END IF;
        
        -- Use the fetched values
        SELECT emp_id AS EmployeeID, emp_name AS EmployeeName;
    END LOOP;
    
    -- Close the cursor
    CLOSE employee_cursor;
END $$

DELIMITER ;
```

In this example:
- The cursor `employee_cursor` is declared to fetch the `employee_id` and `name` of active employees.
- A handler (`CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND`) is used to set the `done` variable to 1 when no more rows are fetched.
- The loop iterates over the cursor and processes each row.
- The cursor is closed after the loop finishes.

### Key Points:
- **DECLARE statement** is only allowed inside the `BEGIN ... END` block and must come before any executable statements.
- **Cursor Declarations** must appear before handler declarations.
- Handlers allow you to handle specific exceptions or conditions.
- Variables can store query results and values to be used later in the program.

By using `DECLARE` statements effectively, you can create more sophisticated and dynamic stored programs in MySQL.
