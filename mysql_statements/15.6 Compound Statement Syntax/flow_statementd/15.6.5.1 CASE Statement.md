The `CASE` statement in SQL is a way to implement conditional logic. It functions similarly to an `IF-ELSE` construct in programming languages. There are two primary syntaxes for using the `CASE` statement, which are described in your input.

### 1. **CASE with a `case_value` (Simple CASE Expression)**
This syntax compares a value (`case_value`) to several possible options (`when_value`). If the value matches one of the `when_value` expressions, the associated `THEN` clause is executed. If there is no match, the `ELSE` clause (if provided) is executed.

#### Example:

```sql
CASE case_value
    WHEN when_value THEN statement_list
    [WHEN when_value THEN statement_list] ...
    [ELSE statement_list]
END CASE;
```

- `case_value` is an expression, and each `when_value` is compared against `case_value`.
- If a match is found, the corresponding `statement_list` (a list of SQL statements) is executed.
- If no match is found and there is an `ELSE` clause, the `statement_list` in the `ELSE` section is executed.

However, **`NULL` cannot be used** in this type of `CASE` statement because `NULL = NULL` evaluates to false. Instead, the second syntax (shown below) is used for handling conditions with `NULL`.

### 2. **CASE with a `search_condition` (Searched CASE Expression)**
This version evaluates each `search_condition` until one is true, and the corresponding `THEN` clause is executed. If no `search_condition` evaluates to true, the `ELSE` clause (if provided) is executed.

#### Example:

```sql
CASE
    WHEN search_condition THEN statement_list
    [WHEN search_condition THEN statement_list] ...
    [ELSE statement_list]
END CASE;
```

- Each `search_condition` is an expression that returns a boolean result (true or false).
- If one of the conditions evaluates to true, the corresponding `THEN` block is executed.
- If none of the conditions are true and an `ELSE` clause is provided, that block is executed.

### **Example with a Procedure:**

```sql
DELIMITER |

CREATE PROCEDURE p()
  BEGIN
    DECLARE v INT DEFAULT 1;

    CASE v
      WHEN 2 THEN SELECT v;
      WHEN 3 THEN SELECT 0;
      ELSE
        BEGIN
        END;
    END CASE;
  END;
|
```
```sql
USE practice;
CREATE  PROCEDURE case_example()
BEGIN
	DECLARE value int DEFAULT 10;
  	DECLARE message VARCHAR(10);
	SELECT  CASE value
		WHEN 11 THEN 'hai'
		WHEN 12 THEN 'bye'
		ELSE 'ok'
	END INTO message; 
	SELECT message;
END;
CALL case_example();
```
``` sql

CREATE  PROCEDURE case_sec_example(IN n int)
BEGIN
	DECLARE message VARCHAR(10);
	SELECT 
	CASE 
		WHEN n=10 THEN 'hai'
		WHEN n=20 THEN 'bye'
		ELSE 'ok'
	END INTO message;
END;
CALL  case_sec_example(10);
``` 
#### Explanation:

- The procedure `p()` initializes the variable `v` to 1.
- Then it evaluates the `CASE` statement:
  - When `v = 2`, it would select `v` (which is `2`), but since `v` is 1, that condition is skipped.
  - When `v = 3`, it would select `0`, but again, this condition is skipped because `v` is not 3.
  - In the `ELSE` block, no SQL statements are executed (it's an empty block). 

So, in this case, since `v` is neither `2` nor `3`, the `ELSE` block would execute, but it doesn't do anything because the block is empty.

### **Key Notes**:

1. **`CASE` cannot have an `ELSE NULL` clause**. Instead, the `ELSE` clause should contain a valid statement or an empty block (with `BEGIN...END`).
2. If no conditions are matched and no `ELSE` clause is provided, an error like "Case not found for CASE statement" will occur.
3. **`NULL` handling**: To test for `NULL`, use the `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` condition within a `WHEN` clause. 

### **Why use CASE?**

The `CASE` statement is useful in stored procedures or complex SQL queries to implement conditional logic, making queries more flexible without needing to use multiple `IF` or `IF-ELSE` constructs. It's particularly useful when evaluating multiple conditions and executing different SQL commands based on those evaluations.
