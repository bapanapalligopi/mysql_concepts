### 15.6.5.4 LEAVE Statement

The `LEAVE` statement in MySQL is used to **exit** from a flow control construct (such as `LOOP`, `REPEAT`, `WHILE`, or a `BEGIN ... END` block). It is particularly useful for terminating loops or stored program blocks early when a certain condition is met. 

If the `LEAVE` statement is used with a **label**, it will exit the loop or block that has the corresponding label. If the label refers to the outermost program block (e.g., a stored procedure or function), the `LEAVE` statement will exit the entire program.

### Syntax

```sql
LEAVE label;
```

- **`label`**: This is an optional label that can be assigned to a `LOOP`, `REPEAT`, `WHILE`, or `BEGIN ... END` block. The `LEAVE` statement will exit the flow control construct associated with this label. If no label is provided, `LEAVE` exits the current block (if no label is associated with the block).

### Use Case

The `LEAVE` statement is often used to break out of loops early or exit from a program block under certain conditions. For example, you might want to stop a loop when a particular value is found or when an error occurs.

### Example 1: Exiting a `WHILE` Loop Early

Consider a `WHILE` loop that searches for a specific value in a dataset. If the value is found, the loop should exit early:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE SearchForValue()
BEGIN
    DECLARE v INT DEFAULT 1;
    DECLARE target INT DEFAULT 5;
    DECLARE found BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;

    WHILE v <= 10 DO
        IF v = target THEN
            SET found = TRUE;
            LEAVE;  -- Exit the loop when the target value is found
        END IF;

        SET v = v + 1;
    END WHILE;

    IF found THEN
        SELECT 'Target found!';
    ELSE
        SELECT 'Target not found.';
    END IF;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### Explanation:
- **`WHILE v <= 10`**: The loop iterates over integers from 1 to 10.
- **`IF v = target THEN`**: If the current value of `v` matches the target value (5 in this case), it sets the `found` variable to `TRUE` and exits the loop using `LEAVE`.
- If the target value is found, it outputs "Target found!" and exits the loop early. Otherwise, it outputs "Target not found." after the loop ends.

### Example 2: Exiting a Nested Loop Using `LEAVE` with a Label

You can also use `LEAVE` with a **label** to exit from an outer loop when inside a nested loop. Hereâ€™s an example of nested loops where `LEAVE` is used to exit the outer loop:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE NestedLoopExit()
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 1;
    DECLARE j INT DEFAULT 1;

    outer_loop:  -- Label for the outer loop
    WHILE i <= 3 DO
        SET j = 1;

        inner_loop:  -- Label for the inner loop
        WHILE j <= 3 DO
            IF i = j THEN
                LEAVE outer_loop;  -- Exit the outer loop when i equals j
            END IF;

            SET j = j + 1;
        END WHILE;

        SET i = i + 1;
    END WHILE;

    SELECT 'Exited outer loop early.';
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### Explanation:
- **`outer_loop:`** and **`inner_loop:`**: These are labels assigned to the outer and inner loops, respectively.
- **`LEAVE outer_loop;`**: When `i` equals `j`, the inner loop triggers the `LEAVE` statement, which causes the program to exit the **outer loop** (not just the inner loop).
- **`SELECT 'Exited outer loop early.'`**: This message is printed after exiting the outer loop.

In this case, the nested loop will stop when `i` equals `j` (e.g., when `i = 1` and `j = 1`), and the `LEAVE outer_loop;` statement immediately exits the outer loop, even if there are still iterations left in the inner loop.

### Example 3: Exiting a `BEGIN ... END` Block Early

You can also use `LEAVE` to exit from a block of code within a stored procedure or function (using `BEGIN ... END`). In this case, if a certain condition is met, the stored program can be exited early.

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE ExitOnCondition()
BEGIN
    DECLARE v INT DEFAULT 1;

    IF v = 1 THEN
        LEAVE;  -- Exit the BEGIN ... END block
    END IF;

    SELECT 'This will not be executed.';
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### Explanation:
- **`IF v = 1 THEN LEAVE;`**: When `v` is 1, the `LEAVE` statement exits the `BEGIN ... END` block, and no further statements in the block are executed.
- **`SELECT 'This will not be executed.';`**: This statement is never reached because the `LEAVE` statement causes an immediate exit from the block.

### Key Points to Remember:
- **Exiting Loops and Blocks**: `LEAVE` is used to exit a flow control construct (like loops or `BEGIN ... END` blocks) early when a certain condition is met.
- **Use with Labels**: `LEAVE` can be used with labels to exit specific loops or blocks, especially in the case of nested loops. The label tells MySQL which loop or block to exit.
- **Exiting Entire Program**: If the label refers to the outermost program block, the `LEAVE` statement can exit the entire stored procedure or function.
- **Useful for Early Termination**: `LEAVE` is useful when you need to terminate a loop or block early, such as when an error is detected or a specific condition is met.

### Summary:
The `LEAVE` statement allows you to **exit** a loop or block of code immediately, which is useful when you want to stop further processing based on some condition. With labeled loops, you can exit from specific levels of nested loops. This control flow statement is helpful for optimizing program logic and managing program flow in MySQL stored procedures or functions.
