### 15.6.5.5 LOOP Statement

The `LOOP` statement in MySQL is a basic flow control construct that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of SQL statements. The loop continues executing until a termination condition is met, typically by using a `LEAVE` statement, or in the case of a stored function, a `RETURN` statement. 

#### Syntax:
```sql
[begin_label:] LOOP
    statement_list
END LOOP [end_label];
```

- **`begin_label:`** and **`end_label`**: These are optional labels that can be assigned to the loop. Labels are useful for referencing the loop in cases of nested loops or using control flow statements like `ITERATE` and `LEAVE` to manage the flow.
- **`statement_list`**: This is the list of SQL statements that will be executed repeatedly. The list can contain one or more statements, and each statement should be terminated with a semicolon (`;`).
- **`LEAVE` and `ITERATE`**: These are typically used to control the loop's termination and iteration, respectively.

### Key Points:
1. **Infinite Loop**: If no mechanism (like `LEAVE` or `RETURN`) is used to break the loop, it will result in an infinite loop, continuously executing the statements.
2. **Use of `LEAVE`**: The `LEAVE` statement is often used to exit the loop early.
3. **Use of `ITERATE`**: The `ITERATE` statement can be used to skip the remaining statements in the loop and continue with the next iteration.
4. **Labeling Loops**: Loops can be labeled, and the label can be used with `ITERATE` or `LEAVE` to control flow more precisely, especially when there are nested loops.

### Example: Using `LOOP`, `ITERATE`, and `LEAVE`

Here's an example of a procedure that uses a loop to increment a value (`p1`) until it reaches 10. The loop also demonstrates the use of `ITERATE` and `LEAVE` to control the flow:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE doiterate(p1 INT)
BEGIN
  label1: LOOP
    SET p1 = p1 + 1;  -- Increment p1 by 1
    IF p1 < 10 THEN
      ITERATE label1;  -- Skip the rest of the loop and start the next iteration
    END IF;
    LEAVE label1;  -- Exit the loop once p1 reaches 10
  END LOOP label1;
  SET @x = p1;  -- Set @x to the final value of p1
END;
```

### Explanation of the Example:
1. **Initial Setup**: The procedure takes an input parameter `p1` and starts with a loop labeled as `label1`.
2. **Incrementing `p1`**: The first statement inside the loop increments `p1` by 1.
3. **Condition with `ITERATE`**:
   - The `IF p1 < 10 THEN` condition checks if `p1` is less than 10.
   - If true, the `ITERATE label1;` statement is executed. This skips the remaining code in the loop and continues with the next iteration, incrementing `p1` again.
4. **Exiting the Loop with `LEAVE`**:
   - When `p1` reaches 10 or greater, the condition fails, and the loop exits using `LEAVE label1;`.
5. **Setting `@x`**: After the loop ends, the procedure sets a user variable `@x` to the final value of `p1` (which would be 10 if `p1` was initially 0).
   
### Behavior of the Loop:
- The loop will increment `p1` by 1 each time.
- If `p1` is less than 10, the loop will use `ITERATE` to skip to the next iteration.
- When `p1` reaches 10 or greater, the `LEAVE` statement will exit the loop, and the procedure will finish by setting `@x` to `p1`.

### Labeling the Loop:
The label (`label1`) is used to specify which loop the `ITERATE` and `LEAVE` statements should apply to. In this case, the `label1` allows you to refer explicitly to this specific loop when using `ITERATE` and `LEAVE`.

### Example of Infinite Loop (without `LEAVE` or `ITERATE`):
If you do not use `LEAVE` or `ITERATE` to exit the loop, you risk creating an infinite loop. Here's an example of an infinite loop:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE infinite_loop()
BEGIN
  LOOP
    -- No exit condition, so this loop will run forever
    SET @x = @x + 1;
  END LOOP;
END;
```

This loop will keep incrementing `@x` indefinitely, because thereâ€™s no condition to stop it.

### Use Cases for the `LOOP` Statement:
1. **Repeating Operations**: When you need to perform a task multiple times (e.g., a calculation, inserting data into a table, or modifying a value until a condition is met).
2. **Early Exit**: The `LEAVE` statement allows you to exit the loop based on certain conditions, which can be very useful for terminating loops early when a desired result is reached.
3. **Skipping Iterations**: The `ITERATE` statement can be used to skip the remaining steps of a loop iteration and continue with the next iteration.

### Summary:
- The `LOOP` statement in MySQL allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly until you explicitly exit the loop.
- Control flow inside the loop is typically managed using `LEAVE` to break out of the loop and `ITERATE` to skip the remaining statements and continue with the next iteration.
- If no exit condition is provided, the loop will run indefinitely, which may lead to performance issues or system instability.
