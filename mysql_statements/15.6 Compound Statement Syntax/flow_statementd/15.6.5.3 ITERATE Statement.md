### 15.6.5.3 ITERATE Statement

The `ITERATE` statement is a control flow statement in MySQL used within `LOOP`, `REPEAT`, and `WHILE` loops. When the `ITERATE` statement is encountered, it causes the loop to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration and immediately start the next iteration of the loop.

The primary function of `ITERATE` is to allow you to skip to the next iteration of the loop without having to check the loop's condition manually or write additional logic. It can be thought of as a "shortcut" to continue looping rather than executing the remaining statements in the loop body.

### Syntax
```sql
ITERATE label;
```

- **`label`**: This is an optional label that can be associated with the loop. When the `ITERATE` statement is used with a label, it refers to the outer or a specific loop if there are nested loops.

### Use Case

The `ITERATE` statement is most useful in situations where you want to skip the rest of the code inside a loop (such as skipping certain iterations based on a condition) and go directly to the next iteration.

### Example: Using `ITERATE` in a Loop

Consider the example where we have a `WHILE` loop that iterates over a list of numbers and prints only the even numbers, skipping the odd ones using the `ITERATE` statement.

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE PrintEvenNumbers()
BEGIN
    DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 1;

    WHILE counter <= 10 DO
        IF MOD(counter, 2) != 0 THEN
            ITERATE loop_label;  -- Skip the current iteration if the number is odd
        END IF;

        -- Only print if the number is even
        SELECT counter;

        SET counter = counter + 1;
    END WHILE;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### Explanation of the Example:
1. **Loop Setup**: A `WHILE` loop runs as long as `counter` is less than or equal to 10.
2. **Check Condition**: Inside the loop, we check if the `counter` is odd using `MOD(counter, 2) != 0`. The `MOD` function returns the remainder when `counter` is divided by 2. If the remainder is not zero, it's odd.
3. **ITERATE Statement**: If the number is odd, the `ITERATE` statement is triggered, causing the loop to **skip the rest of the code in the loop body** and move to the next iteration of the loop. In other words, it won't print odd numbers.
4. **Output**: Only even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10) will be printed.

### Iterating Through Nested Loops with `ITERATE`

If you have nested loops and need to skip an iteration in an outer loop from an inner loop, you can use a **labeled `ITERATE`** statement to specify which loop to iterate.

Here’s an example with nested loops:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE NestedLoopExample()
BEGIN
    DECLARE i INT DEFAULT 1;
    DECLARE j INT DEFAULT 1;

    outer_loop: 
    WHILE i <= 3 DO
        SET j = 1;

        inner_loop:
        WHILE j <= 3 DO
            IF i = j THEN
                SET j = j + 1;
                ITERATE outer_loop;  -- Skip the remaining code in the outer loop and continue to the next iteration of outer loop
            END IF;

            -- Print the values of i and j
            SELECT i, j;

            SET j = j + 1;
        END WHILE;

        SET i = i + 1;
    END WHILE;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### Explanation:
1. **Nested Loops**: There are two loops: `outer_loop` (a `WHILE` loop) and `inner_loop` (a nested `WHILE` loop).
2. **Skipping Iterations**: When `i = j`, the `ITERATE outer_loop;` statement is used. This skips the rest of the code in the inner loop and immediately moves to the next iteration of the outer loop (`i` increments).
3. **Behavior**: The inner loop iterates normally unless `i = j`, in which case the `ITERATE` statement skips further processing in the inner loop and moves to the next outer loop iteration.

### Key Points to Remember:
- **Use within Loops**: `ITERATE` can only be used within `LOOP`, `REPEAT`, or `WHILE` statements. It is not valid outside these loops.
- **Skips Remaining Iteration**: When the `ITERATE` statement is executed, the rest of the loop’s body is skipped, and the loop moves to the next iteration.
- **Labeled Iteration**: You can label loops and use the `ITERATE label;` syntax to control which loop is iterated when using nested loops.

### Summary:
The `ITERATE` statement is useful for controlling the flow of loops by allowing you to skip the current iteration and continue to the next one. It helps in cases where you need to skip certain iterations based on a condition, reducing the need for additional conditional logic or manual handling of loop counters.
