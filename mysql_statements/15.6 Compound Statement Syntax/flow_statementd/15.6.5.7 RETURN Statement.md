### 15.6.5.7 RETURN Statement

The `RETURN` statement is used in MySQL **stored functions** to terminate execution and return a value to the caller of the function. Unlike stored procedures (which do not use `RETURN`), stored functions must use `RETURN` to return a result, as they are designed to return a value.

### Syntax:
```sql
RETURN expr;
```

- **`expr`**: This is the expression or value that the stored function will return. It could be a simple value (like an integer or string), a variable, or a result of a calculation.

### Key Points:
1. **Used in Stored Functions Only**: The `RETURN` statement is used exclusively in stored **functions**. It is not applicable to **stored procedures**, **triggers**, or **events**.
2. **Returns a Value**: The main purpose of the `RETURN` statement is to return a value from a stored function. This returned value is sent back to the caller (e.g., a query or another program that invoked the function).
3. **Multiple Return Points**: A function can contain multiple `RETURN` statements, each corresponding to different exit points in the function, based on different conditions. This allows for more flexible control flow.
4. **End of Function Execution**: When a `RETURN` statement is encountered, it immediately terminates the execution of the function and sends the specified value back to the caller. No statements after the `RETURN` will be executed.

### Example:

#### Simple Example of Using `RETURN` in a Stored Function:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE FUNCTION AddNumbers(a INT, b INT)
RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    DECLARE result INT;
    
    SET result = a + b;  -- Perform the addition
    
    RETURN result;  -- Return the result to the caller
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### Explanation:
- **Function Definition**: The `AddNumbers` function takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and it returns the sum of these two numbers as an integer.
- **`RETURN result;`**: The function ends with the `RETURN` statement, returning the value stored in the `result` variable.
- **`DELIMITER //`**: This changes the statement delimiter to `//` so that the function definition can include multiple semicolons (`;`) without prematurely ending the definition.

#### Calling the Function:

```sql
SELECT AddNumbers(3, 5);
```

### Output:
```sql
+--------------------------+
| AddNumbers(3, 5)         |
+--------------------------+
| 8                        |
+--------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

The function successfully returns the sum of `3` and `5`, which is `8`.

### Multiple Exit Points in a Function:

You can have more than one `RETURN` statement in a function, especially if the function contains conditional logic that might require returning different values based on various conditions.

#### Example with Multiple `RETURN` Statements:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE FUNCTION CompareNumbers(n INT, m INT)
RETURNS VARCHAR(20)
BEGIN
    IF n > m THEN
        RETURN 'n is greater';
    ELSEIF n < m THEN
        RETURN 'n is smaller';
    ELSE
        RETURN 'n is equal to m';
    END IF;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### Explanation:
- **Conditional Logic**: This function compares the two numbers `n` and `m` and returns a string based on the comparison:
  - If `n > m`, it returns `'n is greater'`.
  - If `n < m`, it returns `'n is smaller'`.
  - If `n = m`, it returns `'n is equal to m'`.
- **Multiple Return Points**: Each conditional branch has its own `RETURN` statement, making this a function with multiple exit points.

#### Calling the Function:

```sql
SELECT CompareNumbers(5, 3);
```

### Output:
```sql
+---------------------------------+
| CompareNumbers(5, 3)           |
+---------------------------------+
| n is greater                   |
+---------------------------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

In this case, since `5` is greater than `3`, the function returns `'n is greater'`.

### Summary of Key Points:
- **Exclusively for Stored Functions**: `RETURN` is used only in stored **functions** to send a value back to the caller. 
- **Termination of Function Execution**: When the `RETURN` statement is executed, it immediately terminates the function's execution, and the specified value is returned to the caller.
- **Multiple Exit Points**: A function can have multiple `RETURN` statements, allowing for different return values based on conditions.
- **Not for Stored Procedures**: `RETURN` does not work with stored procedures, triggers, or events. These use the `LEAVE` statement for exiting or terminating execution.
