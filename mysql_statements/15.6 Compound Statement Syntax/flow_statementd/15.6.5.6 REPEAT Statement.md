### 15.6.5.6 REPEAT Statement

The `REPEAT` statement in MySQL is another type of loop construct used to repeatedly execute a block of statements until a specified condition is met. Unlike other loops like `WHILE` or `LOOP`, a `REPEAT` loop always runs **at least once**, because the condition is checked **after** the loop body is executed. This makes it ideal for situations where you want to ensure the loop runs at least once, regardless of the condition.

### Syntax:

```sql
[begin_label:] REPEAT
    statement_list
UNTIL search_condition
END REPEAT [end_label];
```

- **`begin_label:`** and **`end_label`**: These are optional labels that can be assigned to the `REPEAT` loop. Labels are useful when you have nested loops or want to use control statements like `LEAVE` or `ITERATE`.
- **`statement_list`**: This is a list of one or more SQL statements that will be executed repeatedly.
- **`UNTIL search_condition`**: The loop continues executing as long as the `search_condition` evaluates to `FALSE`. The loop terminates once this condition becomes `TRUE`. 

### Key Points:
- **At least one iteration**: The `REPEAT` loop guarantees that the statements inside the loop will execute at least once because the loopâ€™s termination condition is checked **after** the first execution of the statement list.
- **`search_condition`**: The condition is evaluated after each iteration. If it evaluates to `TRUE`, the loop terminates.
- **Optional labels**: Like `LOOP`, `REPEAT` can be labeled, and the labels can be referenced in control flow statements like `LEAVE` or `ITERATE` to control nested loops.

### Example Explanation:

Let's look at the provided example to understand how the `REPEAT` loop works in MySQL:

#### Example Code:
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE dorepeat(p1 INT)
BEGIN
    SET @x = 0;
    REPEAT
        SET @x = @x + 1;  -- Increment @x by 1 each time
    UNTIL @x > p1 END REPEAT;  -- Loop until @x is greater than p1
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

#### Explanation:
1. **Procedure Declaration**: A stored procedure `dorepeat(p1 INT)` is created. It accepts one parameter `p1` that determines the number of iterations.
2. **Initial Setup**: Inside the procedure, the variable `@x` is initialized to `0`.
3. **The REPEAT Loop**:
   - The loop starts, and the statement `SET @x = @x + 1;` increments `@x` by 1 during each iteration.
   - The `UNTIL` clause checks whether `@x > p1`. If `@x` is greater than `p1`, the loop will terminate.
   - The condition is checked **after** the first execution of the statement, so the loop will always run at least once.
4. **Loop Exit**: Once `@x` exceeds the value of `p1`, the loop will exit.

#### Call the Procedure:
```sql
CALL dorepeat(1000);
```

- When the procedure is called with `p1 = 1000`, the loop will keep incrementing `@x` until it exceeds 1000.
- The loop runs 1001 times because it starts from 0 and increments `@x` by 1 each time, eventually making `@x = 1001` (greater than 1000), at which point the loop stops.

#### Output:
```sql
SELECT @x;
```

- The result of `SELECT @x;` will be `1001` because after 1000 iterations, `@x` is incremented one last time to 1001 and then exits the loop.

### Example Output:
```sql
+------+
| @x   |
+------+
| 1001 |
+------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

### Key Takeaways:
1. **At Least One Iteration**: The `REPEAT` loop will always run at least once because the termination condition (`UNTIL search_condition`) is evaluated **after** the statements inside the loop are executed.
2. **Control Flow**: Inside the loop, we can execute any SQL statements (in this case, `SET @x = @x + 1`), and the loop continues until the condition specified in the `UNTIL` clause is met.
3. **Incrementing `@x`**: In this example, the procedure increments `@x` until it exceeds `p1`, and since the condition is checked after the first increment, it will always execute at least once.
4. **Customizable Loop**: The `REPEAT` loop can be adapted to any condition, making it flexible for various use cases where you need to ensure the loop runs at least once before checking a condition.

### Summary:
The `REPEAT` loop in MySQL is ideal when you need to perform repeated actions, ensuring that the block of statements is executed at least once before checking a termination condition. It is commonly used for situations where the loop must always run one iteration, regardless of the condition at the start. You can also use `LEAVE` and `ITERATE` within a labeled `REPEAT` loop to control the flow further, making it versatile for complex logic in stored procedures.
