### 15.6.5.8 WHILE Statement

The `WHILE` statement in MySQL is a type of loop that repeatedly executes a block of SQL statements as long as a specified condition is true. The loop will check the condition before each iteration, and if the condition evaluates to `TRUE`, the statements inside the loop will execute. The loop continues to execute as long as the condition remains true.

### Syntax:

```sql
[begin_label:] WHILE search_condition DO
    statement_list
END WHILE [end_label];
```

- **`begin_label:`** and **`end_label`**: These are optional labels that can be assigned to the `WHILE` loop. Labels are useful when you have nested loops or need to control the flow with statements like `LEAVE` or `ITERATE`.
- **`search_condition`**: This is the condition that is checked before each iteration of the loop. If the condition evaluates to `TRUE`, the loop continues; if it evaluates to `FALSE`, the loop terminates.
- **`statement_list`**: This is the list of one or more SQL statements that will be executed repeatedly. Each statement should be terminated with a semicolon (`;`).
- **`DO`**: This keyword indicates the start of the block of statements that will be repeated.
- **`END WHILE`**: This marks the end of the `WHILE` loop.

### Key Points:
1. **Pre-checking Condition**: The condition (`search_condition`) is checked before each iteration of the loop. If it evaluates to `FALSE` initially, the loop will not execute even once.
2. **Termination**: If the condition becomes `FALSE` at any point, the loop will terminate and control will move to the next statement after the `END WHILE`.
3. **No Infinite Loop (if used properly)**: Unlike `LOOP` or `REPEAT`, a `WHILE` loop does not guarantee execution if the condition is false initially. However, it can still result in an infinite loop if the condition is never updated to `FALSE` inside the loop body.

### Example: Basic `WHILE` Loop

Hereâ€™s an example of a simple stored procedure using a `WHILE` loop:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE dowhile()
BEGIN
  DECLARE v1 INT DEFAULT 5;

  WHILE v1 > 0 DO
    -- Print or use the value of v1
    SET v1 = v1 - 1;  -- Decrease v1 by 1 in each iteration
  END WHILE;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### Explanation:
- **Initial Value**: The variable `v1` is initialized to 5.
- **Condition Check**: The `WHILE` loop checks if `v1 > 0`. Since `v1` starts at 5, the condition is `TRUE`, and the loop begins execution.
- **Decrementing `v1`**: Inside the loop, `v1` is decreased by 1 in each iteration.
- **Loop Termination**: The loop will continue until `v1` is no longer greater than 0. So, after 5 iterations, the loop stops when `v1` becomes 0.

### Calling the Procedure:

```sql
CALL dowhile();
```

This will execute the `dowhile` procedure. Since the procedure is incrementing `v1` from 5 to 0, the loop will run 5 times.

### Example of a WHILE Loop with a Label:

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE dowhile_labeled()
BEGIN
  DECLARE v1 INT DEFAULT 5;

  label1: WHILE v1 > 0 DO
    SET v1 = v1 - 1;
  END WHILE label1;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

### Explanation:
- The `WHILE` loop here is labeled `label1`. 
- Labeling the loop can be useful when you need to refer to this specific loop from a control flow statement (such as `LEAVE` or `ITERATE`) if there are nested loops or conditional exits.

### Notes on Control Flow:
- **Exiting the Loop Early**: You can use the `LEAVE` statement to exit the loop before the condition becomes `FALSE`. This can be helpful if you need to terminate the loop prematurely based on other conditions inside the loop.
  
  Example with `LEAVE`:
  ```sql
  DELIMITER //

  CREATE PROCEDURE dowhile_with_leave()
  BEGIN
    DECLARE v1 INT DEFAULT 5;

    WHILE v1 > 0 DO
      SET v1 = v1 - 1;
      IF v1 = 3 THEN
        LEAVE;  -- Exit the loop when v1 equals 3
      END IF;
    END WHILE;
  END //

  DELIMITER ;
  ```

  In this example, the loop will exit when `v1` equals 3, even if the condition `v1 > 0` would otherwise keep it running.

### Summary:
- The `WHILE` loop in MySQL allows you to repeatedly execute a block of SQL statements as long as a condition is true.
- The loop's condition is checked before every iteration, and if it's false initially, the loop won't execute at all.
- Inside the loop, you can modify variables or perform any necessary operations, and the loop will stop once the condition becomes false.
- The `WHILE` loop can be labeled, and labels can be useful for managing flow control, especially in nested loops or complex logic.
