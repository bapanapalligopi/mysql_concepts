### Statement Labels in MySQL

Statement labels are used to name **BEGIN ... END** blocks and control flow structures such as **LOOP**, **REPEAT**, and **WHILE**. Labels are useful for directing flow control (using **ITERATE** and **LEAVE**) in nested loops or blocks, providing a way to exit or continue a loop at specific points in the program.

### Syntax:
1. **BEGIN ... END Block**: Used to group multiple statements together.
2. **LOOP**: Executes statements repeatedly until an explicit `LEAVE` or `ITERATE` condition is met.
3. **REPEAT**: Executes a block of statements, checks a condition, and repeats the block until the condition is met.
4. **WHILE**: Executes a block of statements as long as the given condition is true.

### Labeling Rules:
- Labels are optional but useful in nested loops or blocks.
- Labels are given at the beginning of a block (e.g., `label_name: BEGIN`).
- The label must be followed by a colon (`:`).
- If an `END` keyword is used after the block, it can optionally reference the same label.
- The label's scope is limited to the block, and it cannot be used outside that block.
- You can use **LEAVE** to exit the loop or block, and **ITERATE** to skip the current iteration and continue the loop.

### Example 1: **Using Label in a LOOP**

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE doiterate(p1 INT)
BEGIN
    -- Label the loop as label1
    label1: LOOP
        SET p1 = p1 + 1;
        
        -- If p1 is less than 10, continue to the next iteration of label1
        IF p1 < 10 THEN
            ITERATE label1;  -- Skip the rest of the loop and continue with the next iteration
        END IF;
        
        -- If p1 is 10 or more, exit the loop
        LEAVE label1;  -- Exit the loop entirely
        
    END LOOP label1;
    
    -- Output the final value of p1 after the loop ends
    SELECT p1 AS final_value;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

#### Explanation:
- **label1** is the name of the loop and marks the beginning of the **LOOP** block.
- **ITERATE label1** is used to skip to the next iteration if `p1 < 10`.
- **LEAVE label1** exits the loop when `p1 >= 10`.
- This procedure will increment `p1` until it reaches 10, and then the loop terminates.

### Example 2: **Using Label in a WHILE Loop**

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE process_numbers()
BEGIN
    DECLARE counter INT DEFAULT 0;
    
    -- Label the loop as number_loop
    number_loop: WHILE counter < 5 DO
        SET counter = counter + 1;
        
        -- If the counter is 3, skip the current iteration
        IF counter = 3 THEN
            ITERATE number_loop;  -- Skip the current iteration
        END IF;
        
        -- Output the current value of counter
        SELECT counter AS current_value;
    END WHILE number_loop;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

#### Explanation:
- **number_loop** is the label for the `WHILE` loop.
- **ITERATE number_loop** is used when `counter = 3`, which skips the iteration and moves to the next one.
- The loop increments `counter` and outputs its value, skipping `counter = 3`.

### Example 3: **Using Label in a REPEAT Loop**

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE process_retries()
BEGIN
    DECLARE retries INT DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE max_retries INT DEFAULT 5;
    
    -- Label the loop as retry_loop
    retry_loop: REPEAT
        SET retries = retries + 1;
        
        -- Simulate a failed process (e.g., payment processing)
        IF retries < max_retries THEN
            -- Print the retry attempt and continue
            SELECT CONCAT('Retry attempt: ', retries);
            ITERATE retry_loop;
        END IF;
        
        -- Once max retries are reached, exit the loop
        SELECT CONCAT('Final attempt: ', retries);
        
    UNTIL retries >= max_retries
    END REPEAT retry_loop;
END //

DELIMITER ;
```

#### Explanation:
- **retry_loop** is the label for the `REPEAT` loop.
- The loop continues to iterate while `retries` is less than `max_retries`.
- **ITERATE retry_loop** is used to simulate retry attempts for a process, skipping the remaining logic when retries are still under the maximum.
- Once `retries` reaches the maximum, the loop exits and prints the final retry attempt.

### Key Takeaways:
- **Statement labels** are used to name blocks and loops, allowing you to control the flow of execution.
- **ITERATE**: Skips the rest of the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration of the labeled loop.
- **LEAVE**: Exits the loop entirely, even if there are more iterations remaining.
- Labels help in controlling complex nested loops or blocks by directing the flow with **ITERATE** and **LEAVE**. 

### Restrictions:
- Labels must be unique within a given scope (i.e., at the same nesting level).
- You can't use a label to refer to handler declarations within the block. Handlers have their own scope and can't be controlled via **ITERATE** or **LEAVE**.
