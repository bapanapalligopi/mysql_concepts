### 15.3.2: **Statements That Cannot Be Rolled Back**

In MySQL, **transactions** allow for grouping multiple SQL statements into a single unit of work. The general behavior of a transaction is that if any part of it fails, all changes made by the transaction can be undone using `ROLLBACK`. However, **certain types of SQL statements cannot be rolled back**, and these include some data definition language (DDL) statements.

#### What Are DDL Statements?

Data Definition Language (DDL) statements are commands that modify the structure of the database schema. These include statements such as:

- **CREATE**: To create new databases, tables, indexes, views, etc.
- **DROP**: To remove databases, tables, views, etc.
- **ALTER**: To modify the structure of a table (like adding, dropping, or renaming columns).
- **TRUNCATE**: To remove all rows from a table.
- **RENAME**: To change the name of a table or database.

When any of these DDL commands are executed within a transaction, **they cannot be rolled back**, even if a `ROLLBACK` is issued later in the transaction.

#### Why Can't These Statements Be Rolled Back?

The key reason that DDL statements cannot be rolled back is that these commands are often considered **metadata changes** to the database structure, which are difficult or impossible to revert in a consistent manner once executed. For example:

1. **CREATE DATABASE** or **CREATE TABLE**: These create new database objects, and there's no guarantee that rolling back the transaction would clean up any associated resources (e.g., files or system-level changes).
2. **DROP DATABASE** or **DROP TABLE**: When you drop a table or database, the physical files (in the case of certain storage engines) might be deleted, so rolling back would not be feasible.
3. **ALTER TABLE**: When you modify the schema of a table (like adding or removing columns), the changes made to the structure cannot be undone easily, especially if the database engine has already made internal changes to accommodate the schema change.

#### Example

Letâ€™s walk through an example where this limitation becomes clear:

1. **Starting a Transaction**:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
```

2. **Create a Table**: (DDL statement)

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50)
);
```

3. **Insert Data**:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (id, name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe');
```

4. **Error in Further Operations**: Let's say we encounter an issue in the next operation (for example, an invalid `UPDATE` statement).

```sql
UPDATE employees SET name = 'Jane Doe' WHERE id = 1 AND invalid_column = 'xyz';  -- This would cause an error
```

In this case, we have encountered an error. Now, we attempt to `ROLLBACK`:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

- **What Happens**: Although the `UPDATE` statement failed and we issued a `ROLLBACK`, **the `CREATE TABLE` statement cannot be rolled back**. The table `employees` was created earlier in the transaction and is now present in the database. Even if the `UPDATE` failed, the `CREATE TABLE` is permanent and cannot be undone by a `ROLLBACK`.

- **Result**: The rollback will only affect the changes made by the `UPDATE` statement (which failed), but the **`CREATE TABLE`** operation is irreversible and stays in place.

#### Designing Transactions Carefully

Because of this limitation, **it's important to design your transactions carefully**, ensuring that DDL statements are not included in the transaction, or at least that they are executed with caution. If DDL commands are necessary, they should ideally be executed outside of transactions.

**Best Practice**:
- **Avoid mixing DDL and DML in the same transaction**. Instead, execute DDL commands separately, and ensure that they are committed immediately before proceeding with the DML (data manipulation) statements within a transaction.
- **Perform DDL changes as atomic operations**. If DDL changes need to be part of a larger workflow, they should be performed in isolation, followed by normal transactional operations for the data changes.

### Example: Problem with Rolling Back a `DROP TABLE`

Let's look at another example with the `DROP TABLE` statement:

1. **Start Transaction**:

```sql
START TRANSACTION;
```

2. **Drop a Table**:

```sql
DROP TABLE employees;
```

3. **Insert Data**:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (id, name) VALUES (1, 'John Doe');
```

4. **Error in Insertion**:

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (id, name) VALUES (1, NULL); -- For example, if the column 'name' is not nullable, this will throw an error
```

5. **Rollback**:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

- **What Happens**: Although the `INSERT` failed and we attempted to `ROLLBACK`, the `DROP TABLE` operation **cannot be rolled back**. The `employees` table is permanently dropped, and we can no longer insert data into it, even if we rollback the transaction.

- **Result**: The table `employees` is deleted permanently from the database, and the rollback does not bring it back.

---

### Summary

#### Statements That Cannot Be Rolled Back:
- **DDL commands** such as `CREATE`, `DROP`, `ALTER`, `TRUNCATE`, and `RENAME`.
- **Cannot be undone** once executed, even with a `ROLLBACK`.
- **Impact on Transactional Integrity**: When designing a transaction, you should avoid including such DDL operations in the same transaction as DML (data modification) operations. This ensures that in case of failure, only the changes to the data can be rolled back, and the schema changes (if any) are committed immediately.

**Tip**: If you need to change schema objects (e.g., adding or removing columns, creating or dropping tables), do it **outside of the transaction** to avoid unwanted side effects and ensure that `ROLLBACK` works as expected for the rest of your changes.
