### 15.3.1 START TRANSACTION, COMMIT, and ROLLBACK Statements

The `START TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` statements are used to manage transactions in MySQL. These transactions ensure that multiple SQL operations can be grouped together, allowing for atomicity and consistency. Letâ€™s go through each statement and the related concepts.

### 1. **START TRANSACTION**
The `START TRANSACTION` statement is used to begin a new transaction. Once this command is executed, any SQL operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.) will be part of the transaction and will not be saved to the database until the transaction is committed.

**Syntax:**
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
-- Or you can use BEGIN or BEGIN WORK as synonyms for START TRANSACTION
BEGIN;
```

**Modifiers for `START TRANSACTION`:**
- **WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT**: This modifier is used to ensure a consistent snapshot of the database when querying tables that support it (such as InnoDB). It ensures that all SELECT statements during the transaction return consistent results, even if other transactions are modifying data concurrently.
  
  **Example:**
  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT;
  ```

- **READ WRITE**: This sets the transaction's mode to read-write, meaning modifications to the database are allowed.
  
  **Example:**
  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION READ WRITE;
  ```

- **READ ONLY**: This sets the transaction's mode to read-only, meaning no data modifications are allowed within this transaction.
  
  **Example:**
  ```sql
  START TRANSACTION READ ONLY;
  ```

**Example using `START TRANSACTION`:**
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
SELECT @A:=SUM(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = 1;
UPDATE payroll SET total_salary = @A WHERE department_id = 1;
COMMIT;
```
- Here, the `START TRANSACTION` begins a transaction.
- The `SELECT` retrieves the sum of salaries for a specific department.
- The `UPDATE` modifies the payroll table.
- Finally, `COMMIT` will make all changes permanent.

### 2. **COMMIT**
The `COMMIT` statement is used to save all changes made during the transaction to the database. After `COMMIT` is executed, the transaction is completed and all changes are made permanent. If `COMMIT` is not used, the changes made during the transaction are not saved.

**Syntax:**
```sql
COMMIT;
```

**Options for `COMMIT`:**
- **WITH CHAIN**: This causes a new transaction to begin automatically after the current one commits, using the same isolation level and access mode.
- **WITH RELEASE**: This option disconnects the client session after the transaction is committed.
- **WITHOUT NO CHAIN / NO RELEASE**: These clauses suppress any default behavior defined by `CHAIN` or `RELEASE`.

**Example using `COMMIT`:**
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;
COMMIT;
```
- The changes (debit and credit) will be committed to the database once the `COMMIT` statement is executed.

### 3. **ROLLBACK**
The `ROLLBACK` statement is used to undo any changes made during the current transaction. This effectively cancels all modifications made by SQL statements within the transaction since the last `START TRANSACTION` or `BEGIN` statement.

**Syntax:**
```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

**Options for `ROLLBACK`:**
- **WITH CHAIN**: Similar to `COMMIT`, it starts a new transaction automatically after the rollback is done.
- **WITH RELEASE**: Disconnects the client session after the transaction is rolled back.
- **WITHOUT NO CHAIN / NO RELEASE**: Suppresses default behavior.

**Example using `ROLLBACK`:**
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;
-- Oops, an error occurred and we need to undo the changes
ROLLBACK;
```
- Here, if there is any issue before the `COMMIT`, you can use `ROLLBACK` to undo the changes and revert the tables to their previous state.

### 4. **SET autocommit**
By default, MySQL operates in autocommit mode, meaning every SQL statement is treated as a separate transaction and is committed immediately after execution. However, in some cases, you may want to disable autocommit to control when a transaction is committed or rolled back.

**Syntax:**
```sql
SET autocommit = 0;  -- Disable autocommit
SET autocommit = 1;  -- Enable autocommit
```

When autocommit is disabled (`autocommit = 0`), you must use `START TRANSACTION` to begin a transaction and `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` to complete it.

**Example:**
```sql
SET autocommit = 0;  -- Disable autocommit
START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO orders (order_id, amount) VALUES (101, 100);
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE account_id = 1;
COMMIT;
SET autocommit = 1;  -- Enable autocommit again
```

### 5. **BEGIN [WORK] vs START TRANSACTION**
Both `BEGIN` and `START TRANSACTION` are used to begin a transaction. `BEGIN` is a synonym for `START TRANSACTION`, but it lacks the modifiers such as `WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT`, `READ WRITE`, or `READ ONLY`.

**Example using `BEGIN`:**
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 1 WHERE product_id = 123;
COMMIT;
```

The `BEGIN` keyword is also used in stored programs for beginning a compound statement, but when used for a transaction, it should be replaced with `START TRANSACTION` to avoid confusion.

### 6. **Transaction Characteristics:**
MySQL allows you to specify various transaction characteristics using the `START TRANSACTION` statement:
- **WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT**: Starts a consistent read (only works for InnoDB and when the isolation level is `REPEATABLE READ`).
- **READ WRITE**: Allows changes to the database (default).
- **READ ONLY**: Prevents changes to the database.

### 7. **Error Handling & Automatic Rollback**
If an error occurs within a transaction (e.g., a constraint violation or a query failure), MySQL will automatically roll back the transaction. However, if you manually issue a `ROLLBACK`, MySQL will also undo any changes made since the transaction began.

**Example with error handling:**
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;
-- Simulating an error
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100000 WHERE account_id = 1;  -- This may cause a negative balance error
ROLLBACK;
```

### 8. **Binary Log and Replication**
MySQL records transactions in the binary log. When a `COMMIT` statement is executed, the entire transaction is stored as a single entry in the binary log. This helps in replication and restoring databases.

### 9. **Non-transactional Tables**
If you include non-transactional tables (e.g., `MyISAM` tables) in a transaction, changes to those tables cannot be rolled back. Therefore, it is advised to only use transaction-safe storage engines (e.g., InnoDB) for transactions.

**Example:**
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE myisam_table SET column_name = 'value';  -- Non-transactional table
ROLLBACK;  -- This won't undo changes to non-transactional tables
```

### Conclusion
- **START TRANSACTION**: Begins a new transaction.
- **COMMIT**: Makes all changes permanent.
- **ROLLBACK**: Cancels all changes made in the current transaction.
- **SET autocommit**: Controls whether autocommit mode is enabled or disabled.
- **BEGIN**: Can also be used as a synonym for `START TRANSACTION` but lacks modifiers.
- **Transaction Modifiers**: `WITH CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT`, `READ WRITE`, `READ ONLY` allow further control over transaction behavior.
